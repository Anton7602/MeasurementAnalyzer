# MeasurementAnalyzer

This simple WPF application, written in C# using the devExpress library, provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing and visualizing data from optical profilometer scans.

The application takes a JSON file containing a dataset of optical profilometer scan measurements. It leverages the power of C#'s deserialization capabilities to efficiently extract the data from the JSON and convert it into a usable format within the application.

The application incorporates advanced data filtering techniques. By applying these filters, the application effectively reduces noise and ensures that the plotted results accurately represent the underlying profile of the scanned surface.

The highlight of this application is its visualization feature. Using a 2D xy graph, the application presents the filtered optical profilometer scan data in an intuitive and visually appealing manner. Users can easily interpret the plotted results, gaining valuable insights into the surface profile and any features or irregularities present.


# Key Features:


• JSON deserialization: Extracts data from JSON files efficiently.

• Data filtering: Reduces noise and enhances the accuracy of the results.

• 2D xy graph plotting: Visualizes the filtered data in a clear and intuitive manner.
